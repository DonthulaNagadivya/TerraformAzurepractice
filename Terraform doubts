***How do craete a resources in multiple locations or regions
***how do we craete a resources multiple cloud platforms(providers)
variable "key"{type=string}
Output"first_string_output"{
value=var.key
}
terraform apply -var "key=divya or rg1"
we can pass multiple variables while applying terraform apply -var "key=divya" -var "size=10"-  During the runtime we can dynamically pass the values to the variables
Sometimes we dont want git to track certain files then we use the git.ignore

When we run the terraform init. it will initialize the terraform and create a .terraform and terraform.lock.HCL
Terraform plan only presents the plan of making  changes 
Once after you run terraform apply it will craete a terraform.tfstate file
If the state has been achieved terraform wont run again to create the infrastructure. I.e If we runTerraform apply multiple times, The infrastructureshould remain the same thats idempotent behaviour
ls, cat and mv terraform.tfstate* ~- moving the file to home directory
Terraform init, plan, apply destroy, show
Drift in Terraform occurs when infrastructure is changed outside of Terraform, causing a mismatch between the actual state and the Terraform state file.
Idempotent means running terraform apply multiple times will not make unnecessary changes if the infrastructure already matches the code.
terraform apply -target=resource_type.resource_name of the resouce block to craete or update or targeting to specific resource then we will use this same we can use to destroy target resource.


git restore filename- undo the changes in working phase
git restore --staged filename- undo the changes from staging
git revert <commit_hash> to undo the commited changes
